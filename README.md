## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size `done`
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division `done`
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference `done`
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS (SCSS)
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

This was a good challenge to take on as I learned alot about JavaScript.

### Continued development

- Formatting the calculator result in the display.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://github.com/Fernando0654/FEM_4_Calculator_App) - This helped me for the theme switching using CSS and JS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice) - This helped me in the `DEL` button as it was just only one line of code.
